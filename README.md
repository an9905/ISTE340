Dynamic creation of at least 3 sets of <select><option>value… nodes

Constructor method that creates the next select menu from the last choice

Use of the following Commands (among many others):

createElement, setAttribute, appendChild, getElementById, getElementsByTagName, createTextNode, nodeValue to name a few…

Do NOT use visibility to show/hide the selections – I want them dynamically created!

Some use of DHTML (menu system, sliding elements, etc. animation preferred!)

No layout with tables! Everything done with CSS

No use of innerHTML! (None at all, I will search for it and hit you hard)

Include comments in the code to clearly explain functionality.

Re-direction of non-modern browsers to a legacy page.
